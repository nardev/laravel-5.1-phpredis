PhpRedis Connector for Laravel
==============================

[Laravel] by default uses [Predis] to connect to Redis.

On servers which have [PhpRedis] installed, you may want to use it instead of Predis for performance. This package provides a drop-in replacement for the `RedisServiceProvider` that comes with Laravel.

Requirements
------------

 - PHP 5.3+
 - Laravel 5.1

Installation
-------------

THIS IS:
laravel-5.1-phpredis
Same package as vetruvet/laravel-phpredis but with small fix for Laravel 5.1
